# From Portland to Portland

## Web Development course at Yandex Practicum
I am participating in an excellent web development course at [Yandex Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.com/) right now.
You get a very good introduction into many web development topics on their learning platform. After mastering the 
according lessons, you have to proof your newly acquired skills in your own projects. 

## My second project
This is my second project that I have implemented as part of the course. It is the first time I am implementing a 
responsive design in order to have an optimized layout for different screen sizes. It uses HTML and CSS and no Javascript.
The layout was specified in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/lNsn9aE1Be6bvg9FeAzRXT/Sprint-3-From-Portland-to-Portland-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)
This was an additional challenge, because it was more difficult to understand what actually has to be done.
