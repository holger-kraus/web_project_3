            Need more action and adventure in your life instead of the same old routine?
            From Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon we're going to take you on an exciting
            journey through some unknown regions of your country. Leave the car at home and
            travel by bike starting in New England where it all began. You will pass through
            12 beautiful states, covering a total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish 3 monumental
            missions. Partying and taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1
            to a billionaire to help eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous
            author Stephen King's house to say hi and asking him to sign your favorite book.

                Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this is an extraordinary and highly underrated
                state
                full of rich history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to be sure not to
                miss.
                As your journey is going to be a long one, you had best be prepared for an arduous trek.
            </p>

                Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European settlers on US territory in the era of
                Vikings, but is also home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy backpack from
                for
                your 3-month expedition.

                There's no better place to lose yourself in nature than in springtime New Hampshire.
                As serene and beautiful as it was in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled than its
                neighbors to the South. So enjoy it while it lasts.

                You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense to pick up some extra footwear?
                Fortunately for you, the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails from this
                state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof
                boots to keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while passing
                through the Appalachians. These boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.

                Not only famous for “The Big Apple,” the state of NY also has several other reasons for going down
                in history. Since the late 1800s Schenectady, “The City that Lights and Hauls the World,” has been
                home to the world-famous General Electric Company.

                This is where modern power generators were born as well as contemporary means of transmitting energy.
                So we figured this would be the perfect place to find a batteryless dynamo light for your bicycle to
                help you see through those dark lonely roads on your adventure. Such a light from GE will set you back
                about $10-20.

                Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word “eerie,” although it can be from time to time,
                is another town worth passing through for several different reasons. While it might be most famously
                known as the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war,
                Pennsylvania also has produced a rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)

            <p class="place__paragraph">
                The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't already guessed, can be summed up by using
                one delicious word: chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most likely, one of the
                tastiest missions you'll ever embark on during this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar
                in the National Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time!

                From the college capital of Columbus to the clean coastline of Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem.
                Earthquakes are surprisingly common in this particular region of North America, over 200 of which
                have registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only
                thing shaking this centrally located state. One of the country's largest and oldest roller coaster
                parks is waiting to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most
                thrilling quests you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved break to
                ride as many roller coasters as you can before continue your bike ride!
